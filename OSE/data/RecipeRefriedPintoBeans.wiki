++ Recipe Refried Pinto Beans

+++ Ingredients
    
PART 1
            * 1 cup pinto/black beans dry
            * 2 garlic cloves whole
            * 1 bay leaf
            * 3 cupts water
            
PART 2
            * 1/4 cup oil
            * 1 medium onion (minced)
            * 1 jalapeno (chopped)
    
+++ Directions
    
        1.  On bottom of giant pan, cook oil, onion, jalapeno 
    
        2.  Cook beans, garlic, bay leaf, water in pressure
            cooker ~ 30 minutes.
        
        3.  Combine, cook about 8 more minutes, mashing.
        
+++ Notes

  You can do more than triple this and still stay way under the pressure
  cooker size, dont add extra onions, consistency gets off, extra jalapenos ok,
  dont add extra bay leaves.

  tripling this made enough beans to fill 5 of your containers halfway, with enough
  for a meal for two leftover, so good amount.
