++ OSE Object Device Signal Audio Isolator Notes


+++ SUMMARY


current state = need to get footprints for evertyhing.
  - need footprint for capacitor.
  






+++ NOTES


  * Even just common resistor components, i realize now, when you generate a file
    to make the PCB you need the footprint, the EXACT dimensions.
      * There is no standard 1/4Watt through-hole resistor size.
      * average is diameter of 2.29 and 2.5mm and a length of 6 to 7mm.
      * Footprint DIN207 for resistors.

  * Never ever trust a footprint to be correct. We recommend checking pinouts and measurements religiously. Before sending a design for fabrication, print it out on paper at 1:1 scale. Place components on top of the paper to check they fit.


  * ROUGH SCHEMATIC

  * Software used: Kicad
    * you make a schematic and it generates files used to manufacture PCB
      * found footprint for TY-250P


* problem: we need the footprint of the isolation transformer, so that we can generate a proper PCB layout file for proper manufacturing. 
  * how to make your own kicad component library and store it on a "cloud".
