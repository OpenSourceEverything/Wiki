ObjectDeviceAmplifierElectronicPreAmplifier 
  Used in audio system,
  parameters optimizerd for audio

* typically amplify signals from analog sensors to line level. 
* typically outputs to a second amplifier which is a power amplifier

* provides voltage gain (e.g., from 10 mV to 1 V) 
* does not provide significant current gain (needed for speakers). 
  * this is typically delivered by the second, power amplifier
  
common sensors/inputs:
  microphones, 
  instrument pickups, and 
  phonographs. 

Can be a stand-alone device, or often integrated into
