++ Main Types Of Stresses On Joints

Before you decide what joint to cut/make, you need to first understand what kind of stress the joint will receive. There are 4 main ones:

Tension – Imagine pulling a pen cap off of a pen.
sheer – Imaging snapping a branch off a tree by pushing it up and pulling it down
Racking – Imagine wiggling a plug out of a socket.
Compression – Imagine pushing a sharpened pencil into a piece of cardboard. This would result in a compression failure.
