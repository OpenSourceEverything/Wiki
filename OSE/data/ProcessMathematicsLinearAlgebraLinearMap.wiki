++ Process Mathematics Linear Algebra Linear Map


+++ SUMMARY

* a mapping V → W between two vector spaces that 
  * preserves the operations of:
    * vector addition
    * scalar multiplication.
  * Can be represented as an ProcessMathematicsLinearAlgebraTransformationMatrix


+++ DETAILS
* The same names and the same definition are also used for the more general case of modules over a ring; 
  * see ModuleHomomorphism.
    * I have no idea what this means.  




+++ SYNONYMS
* a LinearMapping,
* LinearTransformation, 
* VectorSpaceHomomorphism, 
* LinearFunction 
  * (in some contexts)
