++ Process Study Mathematics Function Signal Audio

+++ SUMMARY

a representation of sound, 
  typically using either 
    a level of electrical voltage for analog signals, 
    a series of binary numbers for digital signals. 

Audio signals have frequencies in the audio frequency range of roughly 
  20 to 20,000 Hz, (lower and upper limits of human hearing)



+++ DETAILS

Some ObjectDeviceAmplifierElectronicAudio preamps are just straight gain such as bringing up a microphone level of a few microvolts up to line level which might be -10dBV (.316Volts)(0dB=1Volt) 
or to a professional level of +4dBu(1.23 Volts)(0dB=.775 V). 

Gain on this type of preamp is variable typically from 20–60dB.
