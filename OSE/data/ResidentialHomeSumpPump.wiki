++ Residential Home Sump Pump


+++ Summary

  Water comes in from "Footing Drains" into a pit called a "sump"
    see: ResidentialHomeExteriorWaterDrainageSystem
    
  Once a sensor attached to a ball goes off, the pump activates and 
  goes through a CheckValve and up a tube somewhere outside the house
  
  Getting this water away from the foundation and et cetera is very
  important to structural integrity of the house.
  
  
  If a water softener is used it often dumps salty hard water into 
  the sump, which makes debris and can cause sump pump failure.
