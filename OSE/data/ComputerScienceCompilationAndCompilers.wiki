  ProcessComputingComputerScience
    - checks syntax of human code, converts to machine code, makes object files.
    - as an example RTX is a system built on top of windows, it provides its own API.
      You have to provide *header files* to the compiler, which uses them to verify 
      correctness of code, and to know the format of functions etc. This is similar to
      having #include <stdio.h> except for RTX, its done in project settings to make
      available to compiler
