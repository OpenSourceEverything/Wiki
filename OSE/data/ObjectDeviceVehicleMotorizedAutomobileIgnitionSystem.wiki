++ Object Device Vehicle Motorized Automobile Ignition System




+++ SUMMARY
  
  * technically ignition system should probably be more generalized to ObjectDeviceEngine of types EngineInternalCombusion, EngineRocket etc...
    * However Automobiles are the widest application. 


  ObjectSystem that generates a spark or heats an electrode to a high temperature to ignite a fuel-air mixture 
  Used in: 
    spark ignition internal combustion engines, 
    oil-fired and 
    gas-fired boilers, 
    rocket engines, etc. 
    
    The widest application for spark ignition internal combustion engines is in petrol (gasoline) road vehicles such as cars and motorcycles.

Compression ignition Diesel engines ignite the fuel-air mixture by the heat of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have glowplugs that preheat the combustion chamber to allow starting in cold weather. Other engines may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare. 


  * IgnitionCoil is used to convert car battery low voltage to high voltage needed for sparks.
    * Basically a step up transformer with primary/secondary windings.
    * The output is distributed either 
      * mechanically (e.g. distributor cap) or 
      * electrically via  CPU (e.g. automobile "ECU (ElectronicControlUnit)")
        * when done electronically each spark plug has its own IgnitionCoil.
