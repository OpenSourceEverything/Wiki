++ Process Compilation


Process  
  * a computer takes to convert a high-level programming language into a machine language that the computer can understand. 


The software which performs this conversion is called a ObjectDataInformationComputerProgramCompiler.

If the executable is requested for execution, then the operating system loads it into memory and starts a ProcessComputingProcess.[3] 

The central processing unit will soon switch to this process so it can fetch, decode, and then execute each machine instruction.[4]
