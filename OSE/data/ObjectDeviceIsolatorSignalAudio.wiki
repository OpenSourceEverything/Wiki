+++ SUMMARY

* I think the name needs to change????
* 

Basically a ObjectDeviceTransformerIsolation
  * used for audio signals.
  * Used for:
    * 1) reducing audio signal hum and noise caused by:
           * DC offsets in line
             * DC current cant pass through an isolation transformer 
           
           * AC noise.
             * Usually the isolation transformer used will filter out   
    
    * 2) Bridge an unbalanced stage of electronics to a balanced
