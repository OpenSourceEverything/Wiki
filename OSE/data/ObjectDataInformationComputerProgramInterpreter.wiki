++ Object Data Information Computer Program Interpreter

[Interpreter]
+++ SUMMARY
ObjectDataInformationComputerProgram
  * directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

    Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
    Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code and immediately execute that;
    Explicitly execute stored precompiled code[1] made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.
