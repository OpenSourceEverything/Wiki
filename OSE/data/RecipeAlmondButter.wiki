++ Recipe Almond Butter


+++ INGREDIENTS

3 cups almonds
1 TbSpn
    - mix in food process
      - stopping often to push side matter back down





NOTES
    - do not roast raw almonds for use here, turned out badly
    - probably dont add any salt
        - 1/2 [Tspn] is too much for 3 cups of almonds
    - adding oil seemed necessary to achieve creamy texture.
      - if you dont add oil, still buttery, but very gritty.

    - probably shouldnt decrease recipe size less than about 2-3 cups, blending is slower
      
    - do not use blender, will take hours
    - use food processor. it takes several minutes at the least
      - during these several minutes, stop and push side matter 
        back down.
