HOW TO EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE CHARACTERISTIC PARAMETERS OF A TRANSFORMER.

Finish this from video:

identifying a transformer:

  * 1 - identify sides of the transformer, primary, secondary, input/output.
  
  * 2 - figure out which side is the primary / input
  
  * 3. - 


================================================================================
To measure the output impedance at the secondary of the transformer, as driven 
by the amplifier, do this:

Apply a 1 kHz signal to the input of the amplifier, so that the output is not 
too large, but easily measurable, perhaps 1/10 volt. Carefully measure the 
output voltage with no load connected. Next connect a variable load resistance 
to the output, and adjust its resistance until the output voltage is reduced by 
half. Measure the value of the load resistance. That value will be the output 
impedance.

The output impedance is given by Zo = RL*(Vo/VL - 1).

If the output voltage doesn't change much when you connect the load resistor, 
use lower value resistors until it does.
