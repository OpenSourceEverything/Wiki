++ Cpp Static Keyword

+++ SUMMARY

"static" has different meanings if modifying classes or variables

    * Persistence: it remains in memory until the end of the program.
    File scope: it can be seen only withing a file where it's defined.
    Visibility: if it is defined within a function/block, it's scope is limited to the function/block. It cannot be accessed outside of the function/block.
    Class: static members exist as members of the class rather than as an instance in each object of the class. So, this keyword is not available in a static member function. Such functions may access only static data members. There is only a single instance of each static data member for the entire class:
    A static data member : class variable
    A non-static data member : instance variable
    Static member function: it can only access static member data, or other static member functions while non-static member functions can access all data members of the class: static and non-static.
