++ Object Device

[Devices]
[Machine]

+++ SUMMARY

  * [Object] 
    * AttributeConstructed
    * Usually a constructed [Tool]. 

  * Within OpenSourceEverything "Device" is synonymous with
    * [Machine]
    * [Tool]
 
  * Tricky to differentiate between ObjectSystem
    * i.e. most objects are comprised of more smaller objects.
    * ex:  ObjectDeviceComputerMicrocontroller is a device, or system?

  * For now, Devices wont be separated based on adjective until lowest level.
    * example: Device Hammer -> Device Hammer Electric? 
    * or should we not do this at all? this part not sure about.
    * Example: Car is device, with electronics but it shouldnt be considered a 
      device electronic
