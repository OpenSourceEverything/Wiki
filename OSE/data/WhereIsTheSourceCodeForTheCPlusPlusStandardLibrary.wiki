++ Where Is The Source Code For The C Plus Plus Standard Library

  * There is no single implementation, only C++ standards documents that define the library, and thus its source code.
    * That being said one place to locate *an* implementation of the C++ standard library is from GNU:
    * [GNULibStdC++]
  * it's at least partially built into the compiler itself. In fact, it's not required to have any separate code at all.
  
  * The C++ language is only described by the standard, as is the behavior of the standard library. What you can find is a single implementation of the standard library, not the single.
