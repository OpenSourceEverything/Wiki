+++ SUMMARY

Performs a ProcessMathematicsLinearAlgebraLinearMap

ProcessMathematicsLinearAlgebraTransformationMatrix
  * performs rotation in EuclideanSpace ProcessMathematics


can be seen as the trigonometric summation angle formulae in matrix form. 


+++ EXAMPLE
* say we were at 35 degrees, we want to rotate 45 more. 
  * We simply compute vector endpoint at 75 degrees.

counterclockwise in a right-handed coordinate system (y counterclockwise from x) by pre-multiplication (R on the left). 

If any one of these is changed (such as rotating axes instead of vectors, a passive transformation), then the inverse of the example matrix should be used, which coincides with its transpose.
