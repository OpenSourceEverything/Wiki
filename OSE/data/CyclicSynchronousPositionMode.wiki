++ Cyclic Synchronous Position Mode

rel://files/_ZHIS8I0PUY86BGACW5QN.png

This section describes cyclic synchronous operating modes. In these this modes, trajectory 
generation is done in the master computer (control device), not in the drive, and data is sent to the 
axes in synchronous updates of position, velocity 
or torque.
I
n cyclic synchronous modes PDOs are used to send commands to the drive, which responds 
immediately, without setting bit 4 in the Control Word 0x6040 (as is done in Profile Position Mode). 
These commands are affected by limiting parameters that are usually 
sent via SDOs and don’t 
require cyclical updating.
