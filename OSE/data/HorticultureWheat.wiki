++ Horticulture Wheat


+++ SUMMARY

  * Winter wheats 
    * are sown in fall and harvested the following spring or summer. 
    * A winter variety that does not experience cold weather will produce no grain, 
  * Spring wheats, 
    * which can be either common or durum wheats, are bred for Canadian and northerly U.S. regions where wheat can’t survive through winter; 
    * sown in early spring and harvested in summer.
    * a spring variety sown in fall will die in winter freezes (unless you’re in a frost-free region, where spring wheat varieties can be fall-sown).
