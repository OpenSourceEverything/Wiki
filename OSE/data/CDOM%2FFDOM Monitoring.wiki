CDOM/FDOM Monitoring

Coloured or chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) occurs naturally in water bodies. 
This organic matter absorbs the ultraviolet light and decomposes to release tannin, an organic pollutant that causes the water to turn murky. 
Moreover, tannin contributes to reducing the pH (acidic) of the water and depleting the oxygen levels.

A portion of the CDOM fluoresces and is referred to as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) further making the water look cloudy.
