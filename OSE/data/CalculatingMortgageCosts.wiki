++ Calculating Mortgage Costs


+++ SUMMARY

  * Calculate your monthly payments, and from that determine how much interest you
    pay on top of the actual principal loan amount you are given.

+++ EXAMPLE

* 1) parameters established

Morgage @ 3.875 % for 200,000
P = Principal (200,000)
I = interest rate percent (0.03875)
M = number of monthly payments (12)
Y = number of years of loan (15 or 30 usually)

* 2) Calculate Payment per month
Payment Per Month = 

  P*[I/M] / [1 - ((1+I/M)^(-(M)*(Y))) ]
  
  200000*[0.03875/12] / [1 - ((1+0.03875/12)^(-(12)*(30))) ]
  
  = 933.66$ / month 

3) calculate interest paid
  12months * 30years = 360 payments until done.
  933.66 * 360 = 336117.60
  336117.60-200000 = 136117.60
  
  136117.60$ interest paid on a 30 year 3.875% mortgage loan
