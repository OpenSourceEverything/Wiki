++ Object Device DI Unit

+++ SUMMARY

* ObjectDevice, 
  * AttributeElectrical, either:
    * Passive (no power required for DIUnit operation)
    * Active (DIUnit requires power from some source)
  
  * Used for Signal impedance and level matching/balancing
    * (usualy via XLR Cable/Connector):
    * input:  low-impedance,  MicrophoneLevel, balanced, 
    * output: high-impedance, LineLevel,      unbalanced 

  * Used to [record] an audio signal

+++ DETAILS

  * typically use:
    * with electric musical devices that only contain an unbalanced 1/4" phone output which needs to be connected to an XLR input of a mixing board. 
    
  * typically location of use: 
    * recording studios 
    * sound reinforcement systems
