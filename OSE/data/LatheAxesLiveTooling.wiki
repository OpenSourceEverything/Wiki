++ Lathe Axes Live Tooling


There are three possible spindles on a lathe machine,

the first is the main spindle on the left hand side attached to the machine, this is S1, (or its called C if using S2).

The second spindle is the live tooling spindle, which is basically on the thingy that holds the tool, with the tool changer etc. If
this spindle S2 is active, then S1 magically changes hats and is referred to as C instead, however its being controlled by the same
physical Axis, AX3.

The third is the tailstock thing, called a sub spindle, the TMM12 has a tail stock, but without a spindle, so you wouldnt call it a 
sub spindle in that case I guess,
