+++ Typical Copy Constructor (Line 3)

  * clones the resource from the temporary returned by foo,
  * destructs the resource held by x and replaces it with the clone,
  * destructs the temporary and thereby releases its resource. 
    
    X foo();
    X x;
    x = foo();    // copying object returned from function foo() to x.
                  // 

+++ Typical Assignment Operator

  X& X::operator=(X const & rhs)
  {
    // [...]
    // Make a clone of what rhs.m_pResource refers to.
    // Destruct the resource that m_pResource refers to. 
    // Attach the clone to m_pResource.
    // [...]
  }
