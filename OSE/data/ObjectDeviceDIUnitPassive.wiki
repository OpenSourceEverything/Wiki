++ Object Device DI Unit Passive

+++ SUMMARY

ObjectDeviceDIUnit
  * No power required to operate.
    * passive does no pre-amplification
  
  * AttributeContains (typically)
    * AudioTransformer used as a [balun]. T
      * typically turns ratio is typically chosen to convert 
      * nominal 50 kΩ signal source 
      * 100–200 Ω expected by the mic input of an audio mixer. 
      * typical ranges 10:1 to 20:1.
      * Uncommon: a passive DI unit may consist of a resistive load, with or without capacitor coupling. Such units are best suited to outputs designed for headphones or loudspeakers.
