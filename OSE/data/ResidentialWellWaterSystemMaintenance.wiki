++ Residential Well Water System Maintenance

  0. Always ensure well cap is well sealed. This is vital to avoid
     critters and shit getting in.

  1. At all times, ensure no contaminants can be physically getting 
     into the well itself:
       - runoff from a nearby street.
       - chemicals stored nearby
       - septic tank nearby with your poo poo in it.
         - well head should be 100 feet away from septic drain field
