++ Process Printing Stencilling


+++ SUMMARY
  
  * ProcessPrinting produces an image/pattern by applying pigment to a surface under an intermediate object with designed gaps in it which create the pattern or image by only allowing the pigment to reach some parts of the surface. 
  
  * The stencil is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object;
