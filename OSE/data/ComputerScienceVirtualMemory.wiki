  Typically held in page files, swap files


+++ Details

  A region of memory held in the ComputerScienceComputerDataStorageHardDiskDrive(HDD) (as opposed to in ComputerScienceRandomAccessMemory)
  
  For this memory, we pretend it is program execution memory, that is normally held in RAM. 
    When it actually needs to be accessed by the program,
