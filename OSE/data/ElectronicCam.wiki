    eletronic cam, as opposed to a mechanical cam.
    
    basically a cam turns rotation into linear or vice versa usually, if you look on wikipedia they show a page
    of two rotating guys on a main bar, that both produce movements, within a precise time period. so another source says
    cams are used when movements need to happen at certain times or same time in relation to eachother.
    
    Now what is a cam table. the cam table basically is a table of predefined shit, pulse trains maybe, that lays out
    how tasks should be done in relation to eachother, this is all high level i dont understand but I doubt im even using this on the
    elmo drive anyway
