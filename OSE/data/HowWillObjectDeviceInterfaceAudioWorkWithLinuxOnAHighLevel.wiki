+++ QUESTION(S)



I would like to make an open hardware/software USB audio interface exclusively for linux.

I dont have a thorough understanding of how things will work from a high level. I am hoping for guidance and advice.

Here is what I have so far, flowing from raw audio input to interface output which will interface with computer:

  1) Input Jack for XLR, 1/4
  2) Pre-Amplifier involving RC,operational amplifier
  3) ADCs which convert pre-amplified analog to digital.
  4) Options:
    4.1) Audio Codec o chip I program to convert Digital audio to PCM (or I2S, I2C,...?)
? 5) My device connects via  
  6)
