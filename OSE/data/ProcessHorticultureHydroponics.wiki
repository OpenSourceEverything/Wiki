++ Process Horticulture Hydroponics

+++ SUMMARY

  *Recommend minimal use of this page in favor of horticulture*
    * keep details here specific to "non-soil" 
      * that is a super specific stipulation anyways.
  
  * Hydroponics refers to the growing plants without soil.
  
  * Main ingredients required for success: 
    - water (w/ nutrients), HydroponicsIrrigation
    - light, HydroponicsLight
    - oxygen
    - non-soil grow medium (if not submerged completely in water)
      - CocoCoir
    
  * Uses less water than conventional growing (citation needed)
  
+++ NUTRIENTS

  * HydroponicsNutrients
  
  * All nutrients are provided in water. 
    - hydroponic nutrient mixes contain nutrients not in SoilFertilizer.
  
  * Temperature should be maintained to about +/- 10 degrees (F?) @ ~70F/21C
  
  * water Ph must be between 5.5 and 6.5
