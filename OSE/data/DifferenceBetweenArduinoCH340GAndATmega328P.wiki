++ Difference Between Arduino CH340G And A Tmega328P



Q:

  What is the difference between Arduino Uno R3 compatible board ATmega328P ATmega16U2 and Arduino Uno R3 ATmega328P USB board CH340G? Which should I buy and why?



A:

  See,.there are two components in an arduino board from a programming perspective , one is the microcontroller that stores your program and another is an ic which acts as the bridge between the computers USB and the microcontroller that is Atmega328p

  Now the microcontroller is same on both the boards that is atmega328p, the programmer is different .

  In case of Atmega16U2 one ,it is a microcontroller which has been formatted with a firmware to act as the USB to TTL convertor, this is the official method used by original arduino boards after they discarded FTDI, This is better and efficient although Unless and until you have serious applications it does not offer much improvements and is costly.

  The CH340 is a chinese USB to TTL convertor chip that is specifically made for this purpose ,since this is neither a microcontroller like a 16U2 nor a branded one like FTDI , it is comparatively cheaper ,getting its drivers is a little tough as you would have to download from the chinese manufacturing site and its installation also has chinese language although once install it works fine.

  Comparisons

      CH340 is cheaper ,16U2 is costlier
      Ch340 is an IC , 16U2 is a microcontroller
      Ch340 can not be reprogrammed, 16U2 can be reprogrammed and be used as standalone microcontroller
      CH340 drivers need to be installed seperately , atmega16U2 drivers do not need special care
      16U2 is the method used by original arduino guys from itAly, CH340 is the chinese jugad or hack
      I don't have any proof but I feel Ch340 is a little slower ,just a personal thought
      All original arduino boards use 16U2 or FTDI in some cases.cheap chinese ones use CH340.
