+++ Summary

In computer science, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

Operations associated with this data type allow:[1][2]

    the addition of a pair to the collection
    the removal of a pair from the collection
    the modification of an existing pair
    the lookup of a value associated with a particular key
