++ Object Device Heater Convection

+++ SUMMARY
ObjectDeviceHeater
  
  * uses ObjectDeviceHeatingElement 
    * heats the air in contact with it by ProcessThermalConduction. 
  
  * sometimes filled with oil or thermal fluid. 
  * ideally suited for heating a closed space. 
  * operate silently and have a 
  * lower risk of contact ignition hazard compared to radiant electric heaters. 

+++ DETAILS
  * Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. 
    * This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle.
