+++ SUMMARY

ObjectIdeaMathematicalFunction
  reversibly convert a positive binary number into a negative binary number with equivalent (but negative) value

  Positive numbers are not altered by 2's compliment.
    * i.e. in 2's compliment 0001 is 0001

  * There is a special algorithm to add/subtract 2's compliment numbers
    * Add:
      * 
    * Subtract:
      *    

+++ ALGORITHM
++++ CONVERT BINARY TO NEGATIVE EQUIVALENT
1) inverting all bits 
2) add binary 1 to the value

++++ SUBTRACTION OF TWO'S COMPLIMENT NUMBERS


+++ EXAMPLES
++++ Find 2’s complement of binary number 10101110.
  * invert each bit of given binary number, yielding: 01010001. 
  * add 1 to the LSB of this result: 01010001+1=
  * ANSWER: 01010010
