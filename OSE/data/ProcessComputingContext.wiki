++ Process Computing Context




+++ RELATED
  * minimal set of ObjectData 
    * used by a task (which may be a process, thread, or fiber) that must be saved to allow a task to be interrupted, and later continued from the same point. 
    * relevant to interruptible tasks
      * upon being interrupted, the processor saves the context and proceeds to serve the interrupt service routine. Thus, the smaller the context is, the smaller the latency is.

The context data may be located in processor registers, memory used by the task, or in control registers used by some operating systems to manage the task.

The storage memory (files used by a task) is not concerned by the "task context" in the case of a context switch, even if this can be stored for some uses (checkpointing).
