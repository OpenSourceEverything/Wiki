ObjectDeviceAmplifierElectronic

DC-coupled 
high-gain  typically 100,000
electronic voltage amplifier 
differential input and, 
usually, a single-ended output.

has origins in analog computing, 
  used for mathematical operations in circuits of types:
    linear, 
    non-linear, 
    frequency-dependent circuits.
