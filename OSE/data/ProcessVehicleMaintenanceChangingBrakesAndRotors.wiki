Jack the Car

Remove the Wheel
    -   19mm socket + breaker bar, loosen lug nuts before raising car
    
    
Removing the Brake Pads 
    -   behind the rotor remove 2x 12mm bolts holding the pad caliper
    -   pull the caliper toward outside of vehicle to force piston into caliper
    -   the caliper should come loose, you need to hang it or set it somewhere
    -   until you are ready to reconnect it when the job is done (bungee helps)
    -   brake pads should come out of their brackets by hand
    
    
Removing the Brake Rotor 
    -   after having removed the pads, remove the pad brackets by unscrewing
        2x 14mm bolds on inner side of pad brackets
    -   (optional: if rotors are stuck/very old) use an impact driver/hammer
        and strike near the studs to help break any rotor binding
        
    
    
Installing the New Brake Rotor
    -   place new rotor on your buddy
    -   there are two (i think optional) screws that hold the rotor in place,
        place these 
    
Installing the New Brake Pads
    -   (optional) with wire brush, clean pad brackets, and also re-lube or   
        inspect your pin slides on the bracket to make sure theyre lubed up bruh
    - screw back in the pad brackets, 2x 12mm (45 ft/lbs)
    -   use a c-clamp to push the piston back into the caliper so you can slide
        the caliper back on
    -   with the caliper back in place, re-screw the 2x 12mm bolts (20ft/lbs)
    
Reattaching the Wheel
    -   place all 5 lugs on by hand first
    -   re-tighten lug nuts w/ torque wrench in a star pattern - 
        19mm 5x (90-100 ft/lbs)
    
Testing the Brakes
    -   pump brakes slowly a few times before any driving to help get the 
        piston seated against the pads properly, the pedal shoudl feel firm
    -   test brakes at low speeds first.
    -   avoid sudden stopping when wearing in your brakes.
