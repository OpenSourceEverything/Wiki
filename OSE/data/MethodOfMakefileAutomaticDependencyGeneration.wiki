++ Method Of Makefile Automatic Dependency Generation


+++ Motivation

  GNUMake's built in rule for compiling cpp,c source is basically if(%.cpp changes) then update(%.o)
    This is not enough, for example if a file foo.c depends on changes, you need to update.

+++ Solution

  Use pre-processor from GCC
