++ Git How To Create A Pull Request


+++ SUMMARY
 
  * Pull request is not a git specific thing, but rather a thing of your server or host
  
  * You create a branch off of some "main-branch", say its a branch called "new-work"

  * once all your changes are commited and pushed to the remote server you create a pull request 
    * (not through git but through some other mechanism, such as a web browser)
  
  * The pull request is completed by someone else who actually does a GitMerge operation of your "new-work" branch into the "main-branch"
