  New Zealand needed to answer this question when they realized that none of the species of prized native trees could mature at a rate that would restock their forests.

  They tested around 100 species from around the world, and settled on Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata). It has a maturity to usable lumber dimensions in 15 to 20 years. Over 80% of New Zealand’s plantation forests are now Monterey Pine. This does present another serious concern of monoculture and susceptibility of wide areas to disease.

  Another issue has been found that while thinning at the 15 year age allows remaining trees to grow even faster, the growth rings become so wide that the resultant wood looses much of it structural strength. They found much older plantation forest useful only for low value products such as pallets. It can be used for pulp wood, but the value per cubic meter is much lower than for structural timber. They wanted lumber, not paper!

  But they are learning every step of the way!
