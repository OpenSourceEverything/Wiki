++ Object System Code File Format Instance JSON






+++ DETAILS

Formats like JSON lack the expressive quality of XML, have poorly standardized schema solutions, and lack all but basic data validation. JSON has become popular for primarily three reasons--all valid within certain contexts, but not compelling enough to abandon the benefits and tool set of XML.

    JSON is the underlying data representation for Javascript, and
    JSON is simpler/lighter weight to parse and process than XML, and
    JSON is more compact/less verbose than XML.
