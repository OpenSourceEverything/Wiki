++ GNU Make

  
+++ Summary 

  * A utility that automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.

  * You need a file called a [Makefile] to tell make what to do.  
  Most often, the [Makefile] tells make how to compile and link a program.
  
  * GNUMake is a specific breed of "make". 
  
  * Within this wiki it will be synonymous with "make" (I think its the most used type).
