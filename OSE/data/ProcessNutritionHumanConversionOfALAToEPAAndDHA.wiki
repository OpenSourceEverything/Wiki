++ Process Nutrition Human Conversion Of ALA To EPA And DHA



+++ SUMMARY

* things that can reduce conversion of ALA to EPA/DHA: 
    High intake of Omega 6 relative to Omega 3.
    A deficiency of the nutritional co-factors vitamins B3 (found in peas and mushrooms), B6 (present in soy and oats), C (naturally in broccoli, orange and kiwifruit) , the minerals zinc and magnesium support conversion enzymes.
    Trans-fatty acids destroy the conversion enzymes and tissues have to manufacture new ones to replace those damaged by trans-fats.
    Alcohol abuse poisons these enzymes
    Excess insulin in the bloodstream diminishes enzyme function.



Human conversion of ALA into EPA ranges from 8% to 20%. 
Human conversion of ALA to DHA ranges from 1% to 9%

Example:
  * Ground flax seed 2 TbSpn has 3.5g polyunsaturated fat.
    * 3500mg *
