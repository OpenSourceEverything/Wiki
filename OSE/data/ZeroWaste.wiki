+++ Summary 

* Reducing trivial plastic waste is the focus of most of this information. When
mentioning an attempt to reduce plastic consumption
people will often point out that your credit card is plastic, you drive a car 
that burns fossil fuels, prescription medications are in plastic etc. 

It does not mean that we cannot all stop buying soda at the gas station every day in a styrofoam cup.
Also, a list of larger problems I have not yet begun to ponder will be created to address at a later time.
  
+++ General Guidelines

    * Clothing often has rayon, nylon, polyester, which can contain plastic

    * Reuse - Always try to first buy refurbished and second-hand items. Buying new items
    created a demand for production.
