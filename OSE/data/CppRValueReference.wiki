++ Cpp R Value Reference


+++ Summary 
  
  * If X is any type
    * X&& is called an rvalue reference to X.
  
  * Rvalue references solve at least two problems:
    * Implementing move semantics
    * Perfect forwarding 

  * A reference that can only bind to a ComputerScienceRValue

  * by definition is const.

  * Moves, gives ownership of object (and duty to destroy object) to wherever its being passed.
  
    * similar concept to the desire to pass by ConstReference (const &var) instead of LValue, because
      there is less overhead with copying, dereferencing... whatever else.
    
  * Rvalue references allow a function to branch at compile time (via overload resolution) on the condition "Am I being called on an lvalue or an rvalue?"
