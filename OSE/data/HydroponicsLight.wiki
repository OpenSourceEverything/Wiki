++ Hydroponics Light


+++ SUMMARY



  * Think in terms of $/lumen. Although lumens technically dont apply to plants because lumens are relative to humans. Precise understanding will be deferred for now as a rule of thumb of 4000ish lumens per square foot has yielded very good results.
  
  
  * 8 pack led light bulds, 13 watts, 1600 lumens each, cost = 15$
    * *lumens per dollar = [(8*1600) / 15]  = 853.3 lumens per dollar *
