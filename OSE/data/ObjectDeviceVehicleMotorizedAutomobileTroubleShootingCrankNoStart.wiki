++ Object Device Vehicle Motorized Automobile Trouble Shooting Crank No Start


  * Needs refactored based on electric/combustion

+++ SYMPTOM


  * This symptom means when you attempt to start the


+++ DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
++++ CHRONOLOGICAL/SEQUENTIAL
* When cranking if tachometer exists it should be moving, indicating cam/crank signal is good, else possibly bad.
* Make sure the relay is clicking (activating) when you put the key in ready position,

  
    * Listen to the fuel pump to see if its pumping when you put key in ready position 
      * (may need to get close to it to hear).
  
    * Check Fuel Pressure. You need a tool to measure this in PSI.
      * Some cars have a shraeder valve, which allows for an easy plug in of tool.
      * If no schraeder valve, you have to use a T coupler and manually place your pressure gauge into the plumbing
    

  
  * Electrical / Spark:

    * Cam/Crank signal?  
    
    * Check for spark
      * turn with each ignition coil out and have someone watch for spark
  
    * Check every single fuse and relay related to the ignition system, fuel pumps, spark plugs
    *   







+++ POSSIBLE CAUSES:
  
  
  * Fuel:
    * No Fuel in tank
  * Electrical/Spark
    * Insufficient Battery (if cranking is slow,weak)
    * Battery terminal connections loose or corroded
    * Leak in fuel system:
      * Fuel Injectors
      * Fuel Pump
      * Pressure Regulator
      * ....  
  
    * Fuel not reaching fuel injection system
    * Ignition Components damp or damaged
    * Bad Spark Plugs:
      * worn, incorrectly gapped, faulty
    * Broken, Loose or disconnected wiring in starting circuit (I think this would cause the cranking to be erratic though?)
    * Bad / Disconnected wires at IgnitionCoil or bad coil
      * broken, loose     
      
      
+++ EXTERNAL RESOURCES
  * General diagnosis using fuel pressure gauge among other tools.
