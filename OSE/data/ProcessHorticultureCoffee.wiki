++ Process Horticulture Coffee

+++ SUMMARY

Produces cherries with green seeds inside
  * Green seeds are roasted to become dry/red/black

Average 5-9 years before usable fruit.

The flowering phase will last for about one month. After it ends, the flowers will turn brown and fall off the plant.
    
Over the next six to eight months, the tree will be in its fruiting phase. 
  If the cherries reach a deep red color, they can be picked. 
  If they drop off naturally before reaching this color, the tree is not yet mature enough.
