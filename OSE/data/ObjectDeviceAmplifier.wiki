++ Object Device Amplifier
+++ SYNONYMS
* electronic amplifier 
* (informally) amp

+++ SUMMARY

Electronic ObjectDevice 

* can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). 

* a two-port electronic circuit 

* uses an electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, produces a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output.
  * amplification amount is measured by its gain: 
    * the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. 

* a circuit that has a power gain greater than one.[1][2][3]
