++ Roofing Drip Edge

+++ SUMMARY


  * Drip over underlayment on rakes as said above and under I&W on eaves. 
  * I*W, then drip, then I&W would be superior.
  * We’ve had inspectors make us pull up the bottom 3 rows if our underlayment doesn’t run at least even with the drip on the eaves.
  * Space the drip edge away from the roof fascia: I like to install the drip edge so that the inner surface of the vertical lip of the drip edge is about 1/4" proud (away from) the surface of the fascia board.
  * Even though the outwards-bend of the lower edge of the vertical lip of the drip edge is intended to send water away from the building, this added 1/4" space improves that performance, avoiding the travel of water back up under the drip edge by capillary action where it then wants to drivel down the fascia.
