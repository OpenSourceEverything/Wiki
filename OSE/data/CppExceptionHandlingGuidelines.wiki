++ Cpp Exception Handling Guidelines



  * Throw by value, catch by reference
  * No dynamicExceptionSpecifications, use noexcept
  * Destructors that throw are evil
  * Use RAII (Every responsibility is an object, one per)
  * All cleanup code called from a destructor
  * support swapperator with no throw guarantee
  * draw critical lines for the strong guarantee
  * know where to catch
  * prefer exceptions to error codes
