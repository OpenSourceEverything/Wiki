In software, an audio codec is a computer program implementing an algorithm that compresses and decompresses digital audio data according to a given audio file or streaming media audio coding format. 

The objective of the algorithm is to represent the high-fidelity audio signal with minimum number of bits while retaining quality. 
  This can effectively reduce the storage space and the bandwidth required for transmission of the stored audio file. 

Most software codecs are implemented as libraries which interface to one or more multimedia players. Most modern audio compression algorithms are based on modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding and linear predictive coding (LPC).
