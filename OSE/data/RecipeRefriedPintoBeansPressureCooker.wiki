+++ Notes

  You can do more than triple this and still stay way under the pressure
  cooker size, dont add extra onions, consistency gets off, extra jalapenos ok,
  dont scale bay leaves 1 to 1 with other ingredients

  tripling this made 6 meals of 1 cup bean, ~.5 cup rice-ish, a good sized meal.
