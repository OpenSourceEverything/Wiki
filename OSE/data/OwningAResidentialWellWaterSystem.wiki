++ Owning A Residential Well Water System


+++ Parameters
  
  Flow Rate (Gallons Per Minute = GPM)
            (60-100 = extremely high)
            (6-11   = normal)



+++ Construction and Components

  For a house, outside land has a hole Drilled deep into the rock 
  layer of the land below it.
  This is the well, where little rivers flowing through the rock  
  layer fill it up.
  
  Within the well a motor and pump are placed inside. 
  
  Water from the well is pumped either into your Pressure/Holding 
  tank for later use, or immediately to your tubes if needed fast.
  
  The pressure/holding tank usually has a faucet to allow collection
  of samples and flushing of tank.
  

  Well Pump
    - out by the physical well, pumps water from low in well to house
    - usually has to go up, and over a long distance to get to house

  Pressure Tank, Holding Tank
    - keep reserve of water in house (10-60 gallons)
    - maintains water pressure in house, think of it like a smoothing
      capacitor.
    
    - has a pressure switch that is set when water flows through it.
      - the shutoff switch must come after this, else the pump will
        stop seeing the pressure and kick on all the time and break.
    
    - one of the most important components


  Water Softener 
      WaterSoftening
    - usuallly contains salt.
    
    
  Water Conditioner (I think more rare)
    - removes manganese and shit.

  The following image shows the inside of a house where the well water
  has been pumped in and meets the holding tank. The pressure switch 
  is off to the right side, and shutoff valve is pointed to above it.
