++ Object Device Transformer Isolation

+++ SUMMARY

ObjectDeviceTransformer  
  * used for:
    * transfer electrical power AC source of power to another ObjectDevice 
    * isolating the powered device from power source, usually for safety reasons. 

  * provides galvanic isolation; no conductive path is present between source and load. 
      * protect against electric shock, 
      * suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, 
      * to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected. 

  * often built with special insulation between primary and secondary, 
  * often specified to withstand a high voltage between windings.

  * blocks transmission of the DC component in signals from one circuit to the other, but allows AC components in signals to pass.
   
  * Transformers that have a ratio of 1 to 1 between the primary and secondary windings are often used to protect secondary circuits and individuals from electrical shocks between energized conductors and earth ground. 
  * Suitably designed isolation transformers block interference caused by ground loops. 
  
  * Isolation transformers with electrostatic shields are used for power supplies for sensitive equipment such as computers, medical devices, or laboratory instruments.
