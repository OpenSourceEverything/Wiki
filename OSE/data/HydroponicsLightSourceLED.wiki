    - Light Intensity
      - PPF: x µmol/s
      - measures total energy put out by light per second.
        doesnt tell how the light energy is *distributed*.
        Thats PPFD
      - PhotosyntheticPhotonFlux
        - measured in an integrating sphere.
      
      - rule of thumb: 4ftx4ft area 1000-1500µmol/s
      
    - but PPF doesnt tell you light distribution.
      - Need a PAR(Photosynthetic) Chart/Map
      - This tells you PPFD. 
      - looking for a uniform par chart
      - average PPFD doesnt indicate uniformity,
        so go by the PAR Map
    
    200-600
    
    600-1000(+ if using C2)PPFD
    
    - Spectrum
      - two types of 
        - Mono-Diodes/Narrow band wavelengths.
        - cobs or mid-powered LEDS, white diodes are used, providing all
      - Blue: veg
      - Red:  flowered
        - however both are needed in the opposite side but in smaller quantities.
        THIS IS PURPORTED TO BE A MYTH, need VERIFICATION!
    
    - wattage DRAW 
      - only gives you general idea, must be looked at with
        Efficacy: 2.7 µmol/J

      - correct spectrum depends on plants stage of development
    
    Efficacy: 2.7 µmol/J
    
    
    Input Power: 631W
