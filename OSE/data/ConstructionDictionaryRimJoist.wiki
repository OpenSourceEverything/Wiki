  In the framing of a deck or floor system, a rim joist is attached 
  perpendicular to the joists, and provides lateral support for the ends 
  of the joists while capping off the end of the floor or deck system. 
  Rim joists are not to be confused with end joists, which are the first 
  and last joists at the ends of a row of joists that make up a floor or 
  deck frame.
