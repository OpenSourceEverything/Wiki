* Instructions


    * Soak the Beluga lentils overnight and pick through and remove any little rocks.
    * Once the lentils are ready, give them a good rinse and add 3 cups of water to the pot and cook for around 25-30 minutes with the lid half on. (if using the urad dal, cook for an additional 10-15 minutes).
    * In a deep bottomed saucepan on medium heat, add the oil, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and cumin seeds. Cook while stirring for a couple of minutes.
    * Add in the ground spices—turmeric, coriander, garam masala and cook for a further couple of minutes while stirring.
    * Add in the onion and stir together, followed by the ginger and garlic. Cook further until the spices release a deep aroma.
    *  Add in the tomato puree and cayenne pepper and let it simmer for around 5 minutes.
    * Add in the cooked lentils and beans with 1.5 cups of boiling water. Cook for around 30 minutes with the pot lid on. If it seems a little too loose or watery, remove the lid halfway through the cooking time.
    * Once cooked, stir in the coconut cream and fenugreek leaves if using, cooking for a further 5 minutes. Season to taste.
    * Serve with a sprinkle of coriander (cilantro), chillies and rice. Some naan is also a perfect addition.
