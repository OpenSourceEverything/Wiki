++ Computer ProcessScience Linking

+++ Summary
Linking refers to the creation of a single executable file from multiple object files

+++ Notes
    - there is static linking where the whole machine code of functions is actually 
      copied into your .exe, .rtss whatever is being built so it works. with dynamic 
      linking, it only places a pointer there. One dis-advantage of this is that you
      may not uncover an exception until run-time. An advantage is smaller image size
  
    - uses the object files from the compiler and actually builds your .exe, .rtss,
      device driver file (for windows these are i think .sys, .drv....)
      It does this by having a predefined format
