++ Process Study Mathematics Function Signal Audio Balancing

+++ SUMMARY

  * The transmission medium does not balance, it only allows a balanced signal to pass. 
  
  * Balanced:
    * transmission medium:
      * Three conductors: hot, cold, ground/shield.
        * hot caries signal. 
        * cold varies, but often caries an inverted (180 deg phase shift)
        * ground, zero reference. 
    
    *  
  
  * Unbalanced:
    * transmission medium:
      * two lines, hot and neutral/ground
    
    *
