++ Nominatim System Architecture Overview


https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/develop/overview/ 

+++ 1. Data Import
    
    * done by *[osm2pgsql]*, it uses output at *osm2pgsql/output-gazetter.\[ch\]pp*
    
    * the result of this output is found in database table *place* (NominatimPlace)
    
    * https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/develop/Import/ 
        
+++ 2. Address Computation/Indexing
    
    * takes data from *place* in step 1, adds geocoding info.
    
        * ranks place importances
        
        * links objects
        
        * computes addresses
        
        * computes search index


    * Most of this is done in *Pl/pqSQL* by database triggers
        
        * location:  *sql/functions.sql* 

+++ 3. Search Frontend

    * implements the API
  
    * takes queries, uses backend to return results in desired format.
  
    * Written in [PHP]
  
    * location: *lib*/ and *website*/ directories
