++ Object Device Amplifier Electronic Differential

+++ SUMMARY

ObjectDeviceAmplifierElectronic 

amplifies the difference between two input voltages 
suppresses any voltage common to the two inputs

An analog circuit with 
  two inputs Vin+, Vin- 
  one output Vout
    ideally proportional to the difference between the two voltages:
    Vout = (A)*( (Vin+) - (Vin−) )
