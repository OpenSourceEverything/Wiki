+++ DETAILS

so i need to do a command, and that command needs
to say "do that to audio channel 3"

well according to ffmpeg, the audio channel is called
an audio stream, and there are multiple, each given
an index starting at 0 and increasing.

so I check test.mkv (Death Note - I want to learn
Japanese.)

(i've gone to the directory where the file is, 
and Ive added ffmpeg.exe to my PATH environment 
variable.)

ffmpeg -i test.mkv

    -i denotes that the following is an input stream.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    0:0 - blah balh balhalah
    0:1 - blha balhabalhaaablah

    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I need to do some ffmpeg processing to the output,
and to that processing i need to say

ffmpeg -i test.mkv -map 0:a:0 -c copy eng.mp3 -map 0:a:1 -c copy jap.mp3

that was the command
