+++ SUMMARY 

  * “Fork” is not a Git operation
    * A feature of code hosting sites.    
  
  * Making a copy of an existing GitRepository (and you are doing new development on your copy).
  
  *  This is a common action on GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab
    * anywhere people host Git repos, forking is usually a feature.

  * Whatever code hosting service contains the repo you want to fork (GitHub perhaps?), 
    * look for information about using their API from the command line to GitFork
