          1 teaspoon chili powder
          1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

            2-4   jalapeno (chopped)
    
+++ Directions
    
        1.  Cook beans in pressure cooker
            cooker ~ 10 minutes.
            
        2.  On a skillet cook oil, onion, jalapeno 
        
        3.  Combine, cook about 8 more minutes, mashing.
        
+++ Notes

  You can do more than triple this and still stay way under the pressure
  cooker size, dont add extra onions, consistency gets off, extra jalapenos ok,
  dont add extra bay leaves.

  tripling this made enough beans to fill 5 of your containers halfway, with enough
  for a meal for two leftover, so good amount.
