++ Nutrition Vitamin D


+++ SUMMARY
  
  
  * Techincally not a NutritionVitamin, a group of fat-soluble secosteroids.
  * 
  * Preferable to get VitaminD by exposing skin to direct sun
    * Possible to get from food
      * I found a vegan supplement made from OrganismLichen 
  
  * There are two VitaminD types
    * D2
      * Plant derived
      * Tends to bind less easily
      *   
    * D3 (cholecalciferol) 
      * Animal Derived
      * Tends to bind more easily   

  * Recommended blood level 60 to 80 ng/mL
    * 20 ng/mL is dangerous 
    
    
+++ FOOD SOURCES

  * D3 can be derived from OrganismLichen, closest to a Fungus I think
