++++ METHOD 2

+++ NOTES

  * cook the ginger garlic first, instead of adding after onions, else ginger taste too strong.
    * worth trying without the cardamom, cloves. definitely clovers could probably go. 
    * i bet india gardens version is americanized i.e. less of the super strong spices?

  * Tried with 1 cup chana, 1/4 others. Good consistency, but needed TONS of tomatos.
  
  * Dont add Amchur, overpowered everything, tons of tomatos will provide the kick.
   
  * Added 4 large tomatos cut for the instructions, ended up adding 3 more cups blended tomatos as cooked
  * still not very soupy/gravy like, 
  * recommend cooking tomato sauce separate, saute'ing separate, then combining with lentils?
