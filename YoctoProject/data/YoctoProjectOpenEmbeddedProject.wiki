cross-compile environment. 
  - It allows developers to create a complete Linux Distribution for embedded systems.


difference between OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project?
  - two separate organizations working together, sharing OpenEmbeddedCore/[oe-core]
  - The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded share a core collection of metadata called [openembedded-core]/OpenEmbeddedCore/OECore. 


OpenEmbedded provides a comprehensive set of metadata for various hardware/intent
	Not a reference distribution
	Designed to be the foundation for others

YoctoProject focus: 
  providing powerful, easy-to-use, interoperable, tools, metadata, BoardSupportPackages/ ([BSP]s) 
    - for a core set of architectures and specific boards.
