++ J1939

CAN ID: This is the identifier used to address the message on the CAN bus. It typically consists of an 11-bit or 29-bit identifier, depending on the CAN protocol version.
PGN (Parameter Group Number): This is a key concept in the J1939 protocol. It represents a group of related parameters or data fields within a J1939 message. The PGN is usually encoded within the CAN ID.

Priority: This is the priority of the message, indicating its importance relative to other messages on the bus. Lower values indicate higher priority.

EDP (Extended Data Page): This field is specific to the J1939 protocol and is used to extend the number of available PGNs beyond the original 18-bit range.
DP (Data Page): This field is also specific to the J1939 protocol and is used to further extend the number of available PGNs beyond the original 18-bit range.
PF (Parameter Format): This field is part of the CAN ID and specifies the format of the parameter group within the message.
PS (Parameter Specific): This field is also part of the CAN ID and provides additional information specific to the parameter group.
DLC (Data Length Code): This is the length of the data payload in the message, indicating how many bytes of data are included in the message.
