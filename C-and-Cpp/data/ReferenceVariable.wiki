++ Reference Variable

A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. 

Once a reference is initialized with a variable either the variable name or the reference name may be used to refer to the variable

Reference variables are declared by appending the "&" symbol (without quotes) to the end of the variable type
  * example of an int reference variable:
    * int& iIndex = i;  


+++ DETAILS
* References are an alias, thus they cant be initialized to a constant value like a normal variable:
  * int& iBuddy = 0; //invalid, cant alias to a constant
