+++ SUMMARY


GUI libraries for C++

* three most notable are:
  GTK+
  QT
  wxWidgets

GTK+ and QT are two API's that come with their own widget sets (buttons, lists, etc.), whilst wxWidgets is more of a wrapper API to the currently running platforms native widget set. This means that the two former might look a bit differently compared to the rest of the system whilst the latter one will look just like a native program.
