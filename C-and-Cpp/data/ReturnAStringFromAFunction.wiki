++ Return A String From A Function

+++ SUMMARY

There are three main options:
  
  * 1) have the function prototype such that the return is a const char *.
    * this will be de-allocated when out of scope
    * ReturnAStringFromAFunction
  
  
  * 2) pass in a pre-allocated, fixed size buffer a pointer to the function to be populated.
    * ReturnAStringFromAFunctionExampleUsingFixedSizeBufferPassedIntoFunction
  
  
  * 3) Pass in a double pointer to the function and have it allocated and returned
    * this is probably the most dangerous option.
