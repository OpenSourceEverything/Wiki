++ Settuping Up A Local Repository To Link With An Existing Remote Repository

Add the remote repository using the git remote add command with a name for the remote and the SSH URL of the remote repository:


git remote add <remote_name> git@github.com:OpenSourceEverything/Wiki.git
For example, if you want to name your remote "origin", the command will be:

git remote add origin git@github.com:OpenSourceEverything/Wiki.git
Verify that the remote repository is added successfully using the git remote -v command. You should see the remote URL and its name listed:


origin  git@github.com:OpenSourceEverything/Wiki.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:OpenSourceEverything/Wiki.git (push)
Pull the code from the remote repository using the git pull command:

git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
For example, if you want to pull the code from the main branch of the remote repository, the command will be:

git pull origin main
After executing these commands, your local repository should be synced with the remote repository.
