++ Merge Conflict

+++ SUMMARY

  * result from GitMerge.
  
  * An example merge conflict:
    * a single line of code is modified on both the local and remote repositories.
    


+++ RESOLVING MERGE CONFLICTS

There are three ways to resolve a merge conflict:
  1. take the remote version
    * for a single file:
      * git checkout --ours <file name>
    * for all conflicting files, use:
      * git merge --strategy-option ours
  2. keep the local version, overwriting the remote
    * single file:
      * git checkout --theirs <file name>
    * for all conflicting files:
      * git merge --strategy-option theirs
  3. Manually merge, resulting in a new different version.
    * Can use GitMergeTool or just open the file with a text editor.

You will notice merge conflicts add temporary files to your git repo, take care not to stage/add/commit these. you can resolve the merge, commit, then remove these files with "git clean -f" command
