++ Git Rebase And Merge As A Single Commit



- git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits that you need to rebase> (so you would put 3 after it in your case)
  - use git log to determine number of commits.
  - or use 
    - git rev-list --count HEAD 
  
Change all commits to fixups besides the first one (placing an f in the notepad)
  - optional:change first commit to reword (place r in front of first commit)
  
Then git push -f

git rebase master

then on github rebase and merge, we already did it, but just to be sure.

Count commits ahead of master branch: git rev-list --count master..HEAD.
